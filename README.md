This is a simple unity prototype for a software engineering class I made in college. We met up with a client from Ford Motor Company who told us about an Active Park Assistance system. We created a document demonstrating the software requirements and use cases etc. This prototype was used to demonstrate and validate the requirements that we recorded from the client meetings.
